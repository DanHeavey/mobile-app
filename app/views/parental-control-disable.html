						<p>Your PIN will be required in order to view rated content each time you log on to 4oD but only once per session. You'll have to enter your PIN for each programme you want to view, but you can watch as many episodes of that programme you like without being prompted for your PIN again (until you close your browser to end your session).</p>

						<p>If you share your PIN with, or allow your PIN to be accessed by, anyone else and it is entered by them, then all content on 4oD will be accessible, including 18 rated content suitable only for adults. Please keep your PIN secure.</p>

					<h2>PIN protected content</h2>
					
					<p>Channel4.com provides access to content reflecting the broad range of Channel 4's programmes which may be unsuitable for younger viewers.</p>

					<p>In order to help you control access to the content on Channel4.com from your computer, we have provided a PIN (Personal Identification Number) system. This will enable you to set a PIN to prevent anyone viewing the content you choose to restrict access to. You may find this helpful to ensure children and younger viewers in your household can only view content that is appropriate for them.</p>
